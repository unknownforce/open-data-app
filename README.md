# Tennis Court Locator

## Summary
An open data application that will help anyone find a Tennis Court located near you, whether it is on a hot sunny day, you're bored wanting for something to do with a group of friends, or just want to brush up on your tennis skills. You can filter it with Ratings, Indoors and Outdoors. With the ratings you can see which tennis court is the best.

## Installation
1. Import the 'tcl-google-version.sql' file located under the schema folder in your database. This will give you all of the information on the tennis courts that you need, including longitude, latitude, and address.

2. To access the secure admin page, import the other database file 'users.sql'. This will allow you or anyone else have access to the administration page of your open data application. Just insert the email address and create a password.

3. Replace the Google API Code in the 'index-bottom.php' located in includes folder to your own API code.
